Abstract
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The integrated Geospatial Urban Energy Information & Support System
(iGUESS) is currently being developed as part of an EU project to reduce
CO2 emissions in five European cities. The project is intended to create a
decision support platform providing access to distributed data sources and
distributed analysis and modelling tools through a single web-based interface.
The final goal is to furnish the participating cities with current and
projected space-time energy layers for their urban planning process. iGUESS
provides access to tools that compute local renewable energy potentials and
other spatially bound mitigation action potentials, like the construction of
green roofs or installation of renewable energy technologies. These potential
maps are fed into the non-spatial techno-economic assessment model ETEM to find
the best combination of planning actions subject to a set of objectives (e.g.
emission targets) and constraints (e.g. budget), helping urban planers deciding
where, on what technologies and when to invest. The interoperability between
models and data is guaranteed by the usage of the web service standards
specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The main iGUESS interface
for decision makers is a web-based GIS, which facilitates the spatial
comparison of different model outputs. The system also provides a component for
impact assessment by comparing the results of different scenarios and making
use of spatial multi-criteria analysis algorithms. Another aspect of iGUESS is
the incorporation of uncertainties associated with input data and modelling
results into the decision support.
